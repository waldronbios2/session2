# Session 2: Linear and logistic regression as Generalized Linear Models

## Lecture

**Learning objectives**


1. define generalized linear models (GLM)
2. define linear and logistic regression as special cases of GLMs
3. distinguish between additive and multiplicative models
4. define Pearson and deviance residuals
5. describe application of the Wald test

**Outline**

1. Brief overview of multiple regression (Vittinghoff 4.1-4.3)
2. Linear Regression as a Generalized Linear Model (Vittinghoff 4.1-4.3)
3. Statistical inference for logistic regression (Vittinghoff 5.1-5.3)


## Lab

**Learning Objectives**

1. Define "tidy" data
2. Load a dataset in R and perform basic exploratory data analysis
3. Create descriptive "Table 1" of a study sample using the `tableone` package
4. Create a customized bar plot using the `ggplot2` package

**Exercises**

1. Load the contraceptive use dataset into R
2. Create an "Epi Table 1" of sample characteristics
3. Create a barplot stratified by age and showing the relative proportions of 
participants using contraceptives among those who do and do not want more children.
4. Repeat the barplot showing percentages instead of counts
